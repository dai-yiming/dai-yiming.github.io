This is an elegant-design introduction to MATLAB application in computational finance.

We start by illustrating predictions in stock prices using the grometric Brownian motion model (GBM). Recall the GBM equation is

.. math::

   S(t + \Delta t) = S(t)e^{\left(\mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right) \Delta t + \sigma \epsilon \sqrt{\Delta t}}

Suppose to simulate 100 paths with GBM, we could

.. code-block:: matlab

   epsilon = randn(100, 1);
   factors = exp((mu-sigma^2/2)*deltaT + sigma*epsilon*sqrt(deltaT));

and use the function cumprod to cumulatively multiply the elements of the vector
